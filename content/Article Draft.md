# Key Findings

Zhang et al., illuminate three pivotal strategies in discursive communication: narrative construction, emotional appeal, and design simplicity. 

Jobs excelled in crafting structured narratives. When unveiling the iPhone, he remarked, "This is a day I’ve been eagerly anticipating for over two years." This wasn't just a fact; it crafted a narrative - placing the iPhone within a broader technological journey. Through reiteration, Jobs made products stand out and resonate deeply with audiences.

Emotionally associating Apple products with societal transformations or visions ensured audiences felt part of a collective journey during the presentation. Eliciting feelings of excitement or nostalgia, Jobs facilitated a dialogue where audiences felt personally connected. This use of lexical cohesion – subtly stressing the unparalleled nature of the product– strengthened its perceived value.

Committing to a simplistic communication style - and avoiding jargon in favour of clear, relatable language - ensured accessible delivery of information. These strategies work together, fostering an understanding across a diverse audience, from tech enthusiasts to academic scholars alike.
